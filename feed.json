				"content_text": "<p>this was written by a girl i used to know who is still attached to my facebook profile.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>Every day, I sit and I watch the interactions among men and women in life, television, in theory, and in conversation. And as much as &ldquo;they&rdquo; tell you &ldquo;don&rsquo;t believe everything you see on TV,&rdquo; I am here to tell you that they are wrong. My dear friends, and hopefully people I have yet to meet, can you really sit there and tell me there is no problem? If you are asking yourself, &ldquo;hmm&hellip;what is she talking about? What is the problem? Do I even think women have a problem?&rdquo;, then I invite you to my response within this ever-evolving discourse among women and men.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p><!-- more --></p>\n<blockquote>\n<p><em>¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†My Response:</em><br /><em>to patriarchy, rape, degradation, phallocentrism in all aspects of life, gender/sex/rape constructs&hellip;you can let your mind wander to any possible other topics that are relevant to the submission of women in society today and throughout history and I&rsquo;m sure I am keeping them in mind as I write this‚Ä¶</em><br /><br /><em>Today, I sat down to the middle of a television show that I have watched for no more than 12 nonconsecutive episodes, but nevertheless have come to enjoy on a sub-par level of entertainment. As I sat there and watched an interrogation scene, within a man-made society among a wasteland of divided survivors, I left as easily as I had sat down. And this was for one simple, concrete reason: the seemingly hidden patriarchal sub-texts that are smeared all over everything we watch, and experience, have become a direct threat to my overall comfort as a ‚Äúnon-male‚Äù human. My concern for the effects of the overwhelming abundance of patriarchal hierarchy and its existence in today&rsquo;s society- the language, roles, and expectations/treatments of women by society as a whole, has led me to believe this country is absolutely horrifying.</em><br /><br /><em>I am a woman; I am also what you would call and &ldquo;average&rdquo; citizen. I do not claim any extravagant outcast characteristics that are deemed inappropriate by the general society; I pay my taxes, I don&rsquo;t get paid &ldquo;under-the-table&rdquo;, nor do I disrespect the government which has so overwhelmingly disrespected me. What makes me lesser of a citizen, or being, for that matter, than a &ldquo;Man&rdquo;. Why am I just a, ‚Äúwo-man‚Äù? Who entitled me as such, and who brought such terrible associations to my being?</em><br /><br /><em>When I sat there today, I was subjected to watching a young woman get forced to take her shirt off, and stand before an armed man, who then began removing his belt and unbuttoning his jeans while staring at her. I sat up, moved away from my couch, got all my belongings, and looking away from the television, I excused myself immediately. There is no way to adequately express this emotion to someone when their only response to your discomfort is, &ldquo;thousands of male rape cases never go to trial.&rdquo; What does that mean? I apologize for coming off offensively to anyone sensitive to this subject matter, but believe me, as am I, hence this blog. So why, as a woman, does the man sitting nearby, for the millionth time, say to me: ‚Äúsorry, baby, I guess you‚Äôre going to have to watch another rape scene,‚Äù (in reference to the past several times this has occurred) and I am societally, and personally, directed to be okay with this.</em><br /><br /><em>I am not.</em><br /><br /><em>I am not okay with this demeaning nature that the media has towards women. Nor am I okay with the fact that it is everywhere; I cannot elude it, avert my eyes, or my conscience. Even in my home it is shoving its misogynistic-self right in my face. Why are we a ‚Äúminority,‚Äù when we are technically not one? Why do women get degraded when they have been the ones to provide life to every human on ‚ÄúMother Earth‚Äù? And why, for the love of all that is womanly and powerful, do women constantly get deemed ‚Äúweak, lesser, dependent, emotional, evil, impure, ‚Äúasking-for-it‚Äù (my fav!), and last and nowhere near least, irrational‚Äù, when every woman, every single day, has to combat the media and its propaganda of the image of women.</em><br /><br /><em>I will tell you why my dear friends, oh let me tell you. Look around you! The answer is in your television, you don‚Äôt even need to leave your home. If you do not own a means of video media, pick up a book in your home and the answer is there in between the patriarchally formatted lines. If you cannot read, talk to a person on the street. If you cannot talk, listen. If you cannot hear, observe. If you cannot see, feel it. If you are a vegetable, you have bigger problems than I do, and I‚Äôm not very sure I could understand the means by which you are even reading my blog.</em><br /><br /><em>Not to skew from the point here.</em><br /><br /><em>If you don‚Äôt believe there is a problem with women among this male-dominant culture and language that we are ALL confined to, then my friend, I am sorry, you are not my friend. If you cannot open your mind to the very degradation of women, from whom you are birthed by no exception, that you watch, willingly and subconsciously, every day- then you, my friend, are not my friend. You are ‚Äúthe woman‚Äôs problem‚Äù. You are not necessarily male, or republican, or Christian, or white, or privileged, you are however complacent in your ignorance whomever you may be.</em><br /><br /><em>Now, I ask you this. Am I wrong for committing myself to writing a blog about the problem of women instead of just sitting back and watching a women potentially be raped and treated like a disgusting victim for the male gaze? If I may anticipate your response, my dear friends, if by now all who are reading, are in fact my friends still, I may say, ‚ÄúN-O‚Äù.</em><br /><br /><em>Why is it okay for a man to sit down, watch television, and constantly be off-guard because the man he is watching does not project a victimization by the opposite sex; not to mention the sex of the person they are sitting next to, also watching? Women are constantly forced to be on guard with their ways of dress, attitude, language, eye-contact, type of eye-contact, their ‚Äúrole‚Äù, and their ‚Äúplace‚Äù. Women have no strong standing in the media today, and I am fucking livid that people would rather vegetate in front of a stupid show meant to entertain via topics that are a direct smack to the face of every woman you have ever respected.</em><br /><br /><em>To whomever you are reading this, I appreciate and commend that you have continued thus far, but now I will put this before you and ask of you to please redirect your attention to the issues that surround your every day and effect every woman that has ever earned your respect. There is a seemingly overwhelming focus in today‚Äôs society that people have on things that do not matter. I don‚Äôt know how this developed, and maybe it is just a figment of my silly, womanly, imagination, but I feel that somewhere along the line, we lost a sense of pride in actuality and face-to-face, that we stopped caring about the responsibilities we have as people to people. We, as women, men, <strong>‚Äúothers&quot;&ndash;deemed by society as such</strong>, have a responsibility to take over the constructs we have allowed to build up around us through laziness and a complete lack of regard for the commonwealth. Open your eyes, your mind, your conscience, and raise awareness.</em><br /><br /><em>There is a problem concerning women and men, and nobody feels comfortable about it, because everyone knows they selectively ignore it altogether.</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>*i bolded her &lsquo;apparently too subtle&rsquo; little shout out to transwomen.</p>\n<p><img src=\"uploads/2022/511a6f63fc.jpg\" /></p>\n<p>i don&rsquo;t know.</p>\n",

It‚Äôs been hard for me to figure out because everyone I know who is genderqueer knew before they transitioned, if transitioning at all, and I don‚Äôt really feel right or comfortable with what that says about me if I identify as genderqueer. It‚Äôs often been a word used against me for being queer, feminine, or more politically active than other FTM folks in the area. I‚Äôve tried lots of different terms and pronouns but nothing seems to fit, and I don‚Äôt know how to balance the difference between how people perceive me (sometimes I don‚Äôt get read as male even when I have facial hair) vs. how I really feel about myself.</p>\n\n<p>So basically are there any other guys who after transitioning physically to some extent THEN realized that they were nonbinary or genderqueer? Just knowing there‚Äôs anyone else would be so extraordinarily helpful.</p>\n\n<p>Please reblog so I can just keep track of the notes on this post instead of trying to read through a ton of submissions. Thanks!¬†</p>\n\n<p>-Anonymous</p></blockquote>\n\n\n<p>hi there. :)</p>\n",

The house is my body, and people comment based on seeing the house, but really, there‚Äôs a tree in the living room. I can smother the tree to let the house be, knowing the tree will always be there, or I can knock out a few walls to let the living thing breathe. Yes, to do so would be taking out, or renovating, some of my living space, but it‚Äôs not getting any more comfortable pretending.

				"content_html": "<!-- raw HTML omitted -->\n<p>My chat with Dr W. yesterday has been running through my mind all morning; we talked about how alone and isolated I am. He told me that just sometimes I do long for &ldquo;friends,&rdquo; the company of others, and that&rsquo;s true but most if not all of the time I&rsquo;m better off alone. I¬†find it to be too tedious being around people. I know it&rsquo;s a completely overdone thing but it&rsquo;s true:¬†(I&rsquo;m almost exactly like Dexter) I have to put up a front, put on a performance, pretend around other people. And for those who know what I&rsquo;m talking about, you know how draining this can be.\nWe also surmised that, big surprise, I&rsquo;m afraid of rejection since it&rsquo;s happened so much in the past. I&rsquo;m definitely not saying that I&rsquo;m an exception or a special case, I&rsquo;m not, trust me. (Hah, trust. One thing we didn&rsquo;t get to but would have a lot to talk about on the subject.) Along the rejection line, I¬†can think of situations where I&rsquo;ve put myself out there and got, well, burned (the image of a hand touching fire comes to mind).

				"content_text": "<!--more read-more,--> Internet has been slow today, ever since it went completely out a few hours ago. <s>All I'm really waiting for is a couple films, Silent Hill 2, and the third season of Breaking Bad to finish.</s> My life is just a box of chocolates, isn't it? Even if it was, it'd be the same piece of chocolate over and over again, never changing.\n\nMy chat with Dr W. yesterday has been running through my mind all morning; we talked about how alone and isolated I am. He told me that just sometimes I do long for \"friends,\" the company of others, and that's true but most if not all of the time I'm better off alone. I¬†find it to be too tedious being around people. I know it's a completely overdone thing but it's true:¬†(I'm almost exactly like Dexter) I have to put up a front, put on a performance, pretend around other people. And for those who know what I'm talking about, you know how draining this can be.\nWe also surmised that, big surprise, I'm afraid of rejection since it's happened so much in the past. I'm definitely not saying that I'm an exception or a special case, I'm not, trust me. (Hah, trust. One thing we didn't get to but would have a lot to talk about on the subject.) Along the rejection line, I¬†can think of situations where I've put myself out there and got, well, burned (the image of a hand touching fire comes to mind). When I was a junior at my high school I'd made friends with a girl named J. She was shy and didn't talk very much until she became more comfortable with me.

I can't remember how it came up but I started talking about the gay prom that I was going to (June 2008) and when she asked me why I was going I¬†told her that I was gay and that was the end of that \"friendship.\" She started quoting bible verses to me and I immediately shut down.\n\nThe only reason I¬†bring up that one situation is bc it's the one that stands out the most in my mind.\n\nSo yes, in general I keep well to myself and never let anyone in since it's pretty much never worth it. I tried twice with two different people last semester and both crashed and burned. Maybe the fall semester will be better than the last fall semester?

Could we say \"no sorry, thats gory or shows harm and we have to delete it\"?\nSay someone had a surgery as a kid and has multiple scars...would we have to delete any pictures that show a hint of it?</i>\n\n<i>Yeah i know this is kinda different...but its like i said..it not as if a video of the action was posted. Its scars. Anyone could have gotten them anywhere.</i>\n\n<i>Offensive material can not always be blocked.... Think about it\nIf a christian member came on the board and posted about god everywhere, I would be offended. At the same time, they would be offended at my distaste for religion.\nWould both members be unable to post their opinions?</i>\n\n<i>What if someone completely obsessed with justin bieber came on the forum and took offense to the justin bieber thread and asked we remove it? Could we do that?</i>\n\n<i>Offensive material will be everywhere.... Thats just my point</i>\n\n<i>As a mod, its my job to make sure members are happy and not offended and i am going to do my best to do that, but we cant delete EVERY post that might get on someones wrong side.</i>\n\n<i>I think thats my entire opinion but im on my phone at work so i forget half of what i typed xD &gt;.&gt;, </i>\n\n<i>Opinion made, i will tell you that us mods are in discussion on what to do to make everyone happy.</i>\n\n&lt;3</blockquote>\n\n<i>mood: hot,</i>\n<i>currently playing: \"Peacemaker\" - Green Day</i>\n",

Featuring Christian Bale as the lead character, the film is about Trevor Reznik, a machinist, has severe, chronic insomnia (he has not slept for a year) and has been losing weight to the point of emaciation. The people at his place of work are put off both by his appearance and his demeanor, always trying to ignore him. After a terrible accident (caused by Trevor) costs a co-worker's arm, Trevor is, in a way, exiled from his workplace by his co-workers and his station in the factory becomes his own small island. Trevor says he was distracted by an unfamiliar face, a man he had never seen at the factory, right before he caused the accident. He tells this to his superiours and the persons who were called to discuss the accident but of course, when Trevor tells his boss, knowing the name of the man, that Ivan (the new guy, right?) was the one who distracted him, he gets the response, &quot;There is no Ivan working here.&quot; And now you know that something has gone seriously wrong, especially when Trevor is able to catch up to Ivan and talk to him face-to-face. From there things seem to unravel, he keeps losing weight, writing the newest low number on a post-it and sticking it to the wall in front of the scale. He finds little comfort in the arms of a girl he's been seeing, a prostitute named Stevie. She seems to be the only one who he can find some sort of solace in, her and the woman who works at the airport diner, Maria. &quot;If you were any thinner, you wouldn't exist,&quot; says Stevie. The next time he sees Maria at the diner, she says the exact same thing. Everything is going too fast and flashes of something keeps popping up at different times. Disorienting. I chose this film because the first time I saw it, I could tell from the instant Christian Bale appeared that I was going to like this film. One of the kinds that grab you before you get a chance to brace yourself.</p>\n<p>For the film comparison and contrast part of this paper, I've chosen Pan's Labyrinth and Apocalypse Now. So as to not be repeating the titles over and over again, I'll cut down the names of the films using the first letters of each word. So starting with the former, in comparison, I'd first have to point out that both films are dark in their own way. TM has little saturation; the colours have been sapped out of the moving images. PL is just plain dark, in every sense of the word, too. The skies are always grey and sunshine does not exist in these two worlds. Although PL deals with real mystical creatures and demons, TM deals with different sorts of demons. Insomnia, memory loss (or was the memory even there to begin with?), hallucinations: he's here, he's there but at the same time he's nowhere, he's not here. Not anymore, anyways. Pan, a looming figure over young Ofelia, gives her three tasks to complete before the full moon, having to do with his believing that she is the reincarnation of Princess Moanna. This will supposedly make sure that her &quot;essence is intact&quot; and that she will be able to return to her father's realm. Trevor has to go through a series of things that slowly restore his memory until he is able to piece together what has caused his insomnia for a year, what he has blocked out, simply forgotten, but a part of him has not as is evident upon seeing his physical appearance. In contrast to PL, Trevor has done something that he is being punished for, even if he doesn't know it just yet. Ofelia has done nothing but lead a miserable life full of fear, hate, tears. Ofelia tries to do good, does do good, and ultimately is rewarded for all her efforts.¬† The woman who works at the airport diner, Maria, invites Trevor to go to a theme park for Mother's Day. Just her and her son, Nicholas; he agrees to go as well. The day is no different from all the others in terms of appearance. They are at a theme park; the sun is blocked by the ever present grey clouds pasted in the sky. But still people are having a good time, smiling and screaming and wasting their money on things that will only last them a small while. Trevor takes Maria's son for a walk; Maria herself received a phone call and had to take it. The two come across an attraction suspiciously entitled &quot;Route 666;&quot; Nicholas is intrigued. Using a medium shot showing both the man and boy, the small cart weaves its way through the halls of plastic and mechanical horror, the scenery becomes more extreme by the minute; blatant murders, graves, suicides.

Suddenly strobe lights start to flicker at too fast a speed and Maria's son begins to seize. Trevor rushes out of the ride with Nicholas in arms and cries out for help as liquid white foam drips from the boy's lips. His mother rushes over, puts the boy's head in her lap and tells Trevor, &quot;He is epileptic. I should have told you.&quot; Still feeling guilty, cold sweat runs down Trevor's back; he drives the two of them back to their home. All of this is linked to the repressed memory that keeps Trevor from sleep. You see, unlike Ofelia, Trevor has done wrong, a great wrong and no matter how hard he tried to make things right the truth finally catches\nup to him. Ofelia's ending is that trying her hardest to outrun her step-father and complete the final of the three tasks asked of her by Pan she doesn't physically make it as she is shot by the step-father. I say that she physically doesn't make it because her body was stopped at the top of the stairs leading down to the carved stone but her blood does make it and with just that she enters her real father's realm and is given a good ending. A good ending borne out of tragedy. With Trevor it is the opposite in a way, but nothing good comes of anything in his story. The memory returns after things have become clear to him, like the woman at the airport diner isn't Maria but the woman working there still knows him as well as she did. Maria was the mother of Nicholas who was the boy Trevor accidentally killed in a hit and run. And everything flips, turns upside down. Trevor drives himself to the police station and turns himself in. The last you see of Trevor is him finally sleeping soundly in a jail cell, the burden lifted from his shoulders.

There is always the psychological aspect of each, the type in TM I've explained; Hamlet is talking to himself about whether or not he should kill himself - a pretty heavy thing to be pondering about if you ask me.

Gravity pulls Romeo to Juliette for an instant and in the next moment it forces them apart just as hope had begun to rise in their hearts. Gravity pulls Nicolas' body down from it's temporary flight caused by Trevor's red sportscar and makes him know how much control it has over him, over everything.

				"content_text": "<!--more read-more,--> So I wrote my 6-8 page paper for my humanities class and I¬†like how it came out. I feel like posting it here even though no one will know what I'm talking about. ;D\n\nAnd I've been watching The L Word <s>which has turned me into a lesbian. ;)</s>* Shane is &lt;3333.\n\nxxxxxxxxxxxxx\n\nThe work I&#039;ve chosen to compare and contrast with two films, poems, and songs that were discussed in class is the 2004 film The Machinist, directed by Brad Anderson and written by Scott Kosar. Featuring Christian Bale as the lead character, the film is about Trevor Reznik, a machinist, has severe, chronic insomnia (he has not slept for a year) and has been losing weight to the point of emaciation. The people at his place of work are put off both by his appearance and his demeanor, always trying to ignore him. After a terrible accident (caused by Trevor) costs a co-worker&#039;s arm, Trevor is, in a way, exiled from his workplace by his co-workers and his station in the factory becomes his own small island. Trevor says he was distracted by an unfamiliar face, a man he had never seen at the factory, right before he caused the accident. He tells this to his superiours and the persons who were called to discuss the accident but of course, when Trevor tells his boss, knowing the name of the man, that Ivan (the new guy, right?) was the one who distracted him, he gets the response, &quot;There is no Ivan working here.&quot; And now you know that something has gone seriously wrong, especially when Trevor is able to catch up to Ivan and talk to him face-to-face. From there things seem to unravel, he keeps losing weight, writing the newest low number on a post-it and sticking it to the wall in front of the scale. He finds little comfort in the arms of a girl he&#039;s been seeing, a prostitute named Stevie. She seems to be the only one who he can find some sort of solace in, her and the woman who works at the airport diner, Maria. &quot;If you were any thinner, you wouldn&#039;t exist,&quot; says Stevie. The next time he sees Maria at the diner, she says the exact same thing. Everything is going too fast and flashes of something keeps popping up at different times. Disorienting. I chose this film because the first time I saw it, I could tell from the instant Christian Bale appeared that I was going to like this film. One of the kinds that grab you before you get a chance to brace yourself.\n\nFor the film comparison and contrast part of this paper, I&#039;ve chosen Pan&#039;s Labyrinth and Apocalypse Now. So as to not be repeating the titles over and over again, I&#039;ll cut down the names of the films using the first letters of each word. So starting with the former, in comparison, I&#039;d first have to point out that both films are dark in their own way. TM has little saturation; the colours have been sapped out of the moving images. PL is just plain dark, in every sense of the word, too. The skies are always grey and sunshine does not exist in these two worlds. Although PL deals with real mystical creatures and demons, TM deals with different sorts of demons. Insomnia, memory loss (or was the memory even there to begin with?), hallucinations: he&#039;s here, he&#039;s there but at the same time he&#039;s nowhere, he&#039;s not here. Not anymore, anyways. Pan, a looming figure over young Ofelia, gives her three tasks to complete before the full moon, having to do with his believing that she is the reincarnation of Princess Moanna. This will supposedly make sure that her &quot;essence is intact&quot; and that she will be able to return to her father&#039;s realm. Trevor has to go through a series of things that slowly restore his memory until he is able to piece together what has caused his insomnia for a year, what he has blocked out, simply forgotten, but a part of him has not as is evident upon seeing his physical appearance. In contrast to PL, Trevor has done something that he is being punished for, even if he doesn&#039;t know it just yet. Ofelia has done nothing but lead a miserable life full of fear, hate, tears. Ofelia tries to do good, does do good, and ultimately is rewarded for all her efforts.¬† The woman who works at the airport diner, Maria, invites Trevor to go to a theme park for Mother&#039;s Day. Just her and her son, Nicholas; he agrees to go as well. The day is no different from all the others in terms of appearance. They are at a theme park; the sun is blocked by the ever present grey clouds pasted in the sky. But still people are having a good time, smiling and screaming and wasting their money on things that will only last them a small while. Trevor takes Maria&#039;s son for a walk; Maria herself received a phone call and had to take it. The two come across an attraction suspiciously entitled &quot;Route 666;&quot; Nicholas is intrigued. Using a medium shot showing both the man and boy, the small cart weaves its way through the halls of plastic and mechanical horror, the scenery becomes more extreme by the minute; blatant murders, graves, suicides. A fork in the tracks appears: the one on the right all lit up white with a sign offering heaven, solace. The other one that leads off to the left continues deeper into hell. &quot;Right, a right!&quot; Trevor yells out loud but of course\nthe ride delves into the darker of the two tunnels. Suddenly strobe lights start to flicker at too fast a speed and Maria&#039;s son begins to seize. Trevor rushes out of the ride with Nicholas in arms and cries out for help as liquid white foam drips from the boy&#039;s lips. His mother rushes over, puts the boy&#039;s head in her lap and tells Trevor, &quot;He is epileptic. I should have told you.&quot; Still feeling guilty, cold sweat runs down Trevor&#039;s back; he drives the two of them back to their home. All of this is linked to the repressed memory that keeps Trevor from sleep.

I watched a film called <i>2 Days</i> w/Paul Rudd; the main character decides to kill himself and document it on film. He tried to do it by sitting in the car, you know, a hose from the tail pipe to the window and start the engine. He, at the \"last minute\" backed out and opened the car door and gets to the hospital. The film ends on a note of \"hope\" and even though I love Paul Rudd, I wanted [his] character to succeed. Despite that disappointment, it gave me an idea. I can use a hose and do the same thing in the car in the garage. It's so fucking tempting. I don't know if I'd wake anyone up when I start the engine - I¬†hope not. That'll be my next attempt - but I'll wait until after Friday (when I¬†see Dr. W) so I¬†can talk about it first.
